\description{
Calculates the theoretical plate number \emph{N}, Height Equivalent to a Theoretical Plate (HETP),
reduced plate height \emph{h}, and separation impedance \emph{E} using various methods such as 5-sigma (S5),
European/British Pharmacopoeia (EP), Area-Height (AH), and Exponentially-Modified Gaussian (EMG). See \strong{Details} for further
information.

\details{
The number of theoretical plates \eqn{N} is a widely-used column performance index where a higher number of theoretical plates
represents better column efficiency. Several methods of calculation are implemented in \pkg{lcqc}. The full-width method
uses the 'base width' \eqn{W_b} of a Gaussian peak defined as the baseline intercepts of tangent lines for a perfect Gaussian
peak, which occur at \strong{13.4\% peak height}.
\deqn{N_{FW} = 16(t_R/W_b)^2}
The \strong{5-sigma} method utilises the fact that a perfectly Gaussian peak is exactly 5-sigma (i.e. 5 standard deviations)
wide at a 4.4\% height (Bidlingmeyer & Warren Jr., 1984; Villalon, 2023) and uses the 5-sigma measure to determine width.
This helps cope with tailing often encountered in chromatography, which distorts the peak from its Gaussian shape.
\deqn{N_{5\sigma} = 25(t_R/W_{5\sigma})^2}
The European Pharmacopoeia (EP) method is perhaps the most popular and uses the peak width at half-height (\eqn{W_{50}}) along
with retention time \eqn{t_R}. Since the coefficient used varies from 5.55 in the German (DAB), British (BP), and European (EP)
Pharmacopoeias to 5.54 in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (Rev. 15, April 2006), a mean of these (5.545) was implemented herein.
\deqn{N_{EP} = 5.545(t_R/W_{50})^2}.
#' An alternative equation uses the theoretical Gaussian inflection point width at ca. 60.7\% peak height.
\deqn{N_{inf} = 4(t_R/w_{60.7})^2}
True to its name, the Area-Height (AH) method utilizes peak area \eqn{A} and height \eqn{H} to calculate \eqn{N}.
\deqn{N_{AH} = 2\pi(t_RH/A)^2}
All of the above methods are based on a true Gaussian peak shape, which is almost never encountered in practical chromatography.
Tailing and (less prevalent) fronting phenomena distort the peak shape and cause errors in calculation. A simple equation that
results in "approximately accurate" (Meyer, 2010) values of \eqn{N} and based on the Exponentially-Modified Gaussian (EMG) model
was proposed by Foley & Dorsey (1983). The equation uses the peak width (\eqn{W_{10}}) and half-widths at 10\% height
(\eqn{b} and \eqn{a} for trailing and leading width, respectively). The number of theoretical plates obtained via this equation
is usually lower than that from other methods.
\deqn{N_{EMG} = (41.7(t_R/W_{10})^2)/(b/a + 1.25)}
Also calculated is the plate height, also known as Height Equivalent to a Theoretical Plate (HETP) is the distance in mm (or µm)
over which chromatographic equilibrium is achieved. This is simply related to \eqn{N} and column length \eqn{L} by:
\deqn{HETP = L/N}
From HETP, the reduced plate height \eqn{h} may also be calculated provided the average particle size of the stationary phase
\eqn{d_p} (in µm) is known; \eqn{h} is a dimensionless parameter and may be used to compare columns of different length
and particle size more easily. Values of \eqn{h} should be in range of \strong{2 to 5 (lower is better)}. For example, at a value
of 3, complete chromatographic equilibrium is obtained over 3 layers of stationary phase (Meyer, 2010).
\deqn{h = HETP/d_p}
Finally, Separation Impedance \eqn{E} is a measure of column "quality" (efficiency) that incorporates back pressure (\eqn{\Delta p}),
number of theoretical plates, dynamic viscosity of the mobile phase (\eqn{\eta}, in mPas), and breakthrough time.
Values of \strong{<10000} are imperative for a liquid chromatography process to be considered "high performance" (Meyer, 2010).
In \pkg{lcqc}, \eqn{E} may either be calculated separately for each individual value of \eqn{N} (much like \eqn{HETP} and \eqn{h})
when \code{imped_met} includes \code{"indiv"}. In this case, the following equation is used:
\deqn{E = (\Delta p t_0)/(N^2\eta)}
Additionally, a universal equation independent of \eqn{N} may be used when \code{imped_met} includes \code{"univ"} (default).
\deqn{E = (10^8/5.54^2)\times(\Delta p t_0/\eta)\times(W_{50}/t_R)^4}
