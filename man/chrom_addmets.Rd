\description{
This function uses various column characteristics such as length, particle size,
flow rate, internal diameter (among others) to calculate various column performance indicators.
See \strong{Details} for further information.

\details{
The linear velocity \eqn{\mu} of the mobile phase is simply related to column length \eqn{L_c} and true breakthrough time \eqn{t_0}.
\deqn{\mu = L_c/t_0}
It may be beneficial to verify breakthrough time in this equation, i.e. determine whether the non-retained analyte is really passing
through the column at the velocity of the mobile phase, by calculating packing porosity \eqn{\epsilon}. The packing porosity of
\strong{bonded} silica-based stationary phases is \emph{ca.} 0.65. Using this value as reference, \eqn{\epsilon} may be calculated
simply from \eqn{t_0\text{ }(s)}, \eqn{L_c\text{ }(mm)}, flow rate \eqn{F\text{ }(mL\text{ }min^{-1})}, and inner column diameter
\eqn{d_c^2\text{ }(mm^2)}.
\deqn{\epsilon = 21\times[(Ft_0)/(d_c^2L_c)]}
Significantly higher or lower values of \eqn{\epsilon} (>1 and <0.5, respectively) indicate retention of the analyte or its exclusion
from the pores of the stationary phase (Meyer, 2010).
Another useful metric is permeability \eqn{K}, which incorporates back pressure \eqn{\Delta\rho\text{ }(bar)}. A large value of \eqn{K}
indicates poor column packing, while the reverse is characteristic of a leak. Values of \eqn{15\text{ }mm^2\text{ }s^{-1}\text{ }bar^{-1}}
are typical for bonded phases at a fast flow rate of \eqn{1.6\text{ }mL\text{ }min^{-1}}.
\deqn{K = L_c^2/(\Delta\rho t_0)}
Specific permeability \eqn{K^{\circ}\text{ }(mm^{-2})} may also be calculated (typically \eqn{4.0\times 10^{-8}\text{ }mm^2} for bonded
phases) by incorporating flow rate, dynamic viscosity, column length, inner diameter, and back pressure.
\deqn{K^{\circ} = 21\times 10^-8\times[(F\eta L_c)/(d_c^2\Delta\rho)]}
Finally, \eqn{K} may be represented as a dimensionless metric called Flow Resistance \eqn{\Phi}, which facilitates comparison of different columns.
One of the additional required parameters is particle size \eqn{d_p\text{ }(\mu m)}.
\deqn{\Phi = 4.7\times[(\Delta\rho d_p^2 d_c^2)/(L_c \eta F)]}.
A typical \eqn{\Phi} value of 1000 is observed for packed HPLC columns. Significant upward and downward deviations (e.g. >2000 or <500)
are indicative of a blockage or voids in the packing, respectively.

For calculation of theoretical plates and additional dimensionless metrics such as reduced plate height and Separation Impedance
to assess column performance, see \code{\link{chrom_tplate}}.
