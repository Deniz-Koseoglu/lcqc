\usage{
chrom_smooth(x, method = "rect", pts = 3, passes = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Input numeric vector of equi-spaced values.}

\item{method}{Smoothing method. One of: \code{"rect"} (rectangular), \code{"tri"} (triangular), \code{"sg_quad"} (S-G quadratic), or \code{"sg_quart"} (S-G quartic, see \strong{Details}).}

\item{pts}{Number of points to use for smoothing (defaults to \code{3}).}

\item{passes}{Number of smoothing passes to apply (defaults to \code{3}).}
}
\value{
The smoothed signal (as a numeric vector).
}
\description{
Smoothes an equi-spaced signal using various common approaches, including rectangular, triangular, and Savitsky-Golay (S-G) smoothing.
}
\details{
The function includes several smoothing approaches. The simplest \code{method}, \code{"rect"}, is a \emph{rectangular boxcar} algoithm,
which replaces each points with the \code{\link[base]{mean}} of several neighboring points. For example, for a 3-point smooth:
\deqn{S_j=\frac{Y_{j-1}+Y_j+Y_{j+1}}{3}}
Triangular smoothing (\code{"tri"}) implements a weighted algorithm. For example, a 5-point smooth becomes:
\deqn{S_j=\frac{Y_{j-2}+2Y_{j-1}+3Y_j+2Y_{j+1}+Y_{j+2}}{9}}
Finally, the Savitsky-Golay (S-G) smoothing methods, also known as digital smoothing polynomial filters, implement moving average-based
smoothing via a quadratic (\code{"sg_quad"}) or quartic (\code{"sg_quart"}) polynomial regression. The latter usually performs better
with narrower peaks, but may distort wider peaks.
