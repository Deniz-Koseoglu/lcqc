### Separation Factor

This module calculates the retention and **separation factors** for any number of peak pairs. Separation factor $\alpha$ 
(or *relative retention* in some older texts) is useful to determine the relative degree of separation between any 
two peaks in a chromatogram. It is therefore a **measure of selectivity**. For two peaks $i$ and a **later-eluting** 
$j$, $\alpha$ can be calculated as a simple ratio of retention factors $k_i$ and $k_j$. If $\alpha =< 1$, 
**no separation** between the components takes place.

$$ \alpha = k_j/k_i $$
