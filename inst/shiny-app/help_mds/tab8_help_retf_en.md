### Retention Factor

The retention factor $k$ is used to gauge the relative retention of an analyte compared to that of an unretained solute (such as uracil
for reversed-phase separations). It is calculated from dead time $t_0$, a.k.a. breakthrough time, using the following simple equation:

$$ k = (t_R-t_0)/t_0 $$

Typical RP separations include compounds with $k$ ranging between 1 and 10 (up to 20 for difficult separations). In addition to providing
a retention time manually, it is possible to set the dead time as the retention time of one of the peaks by setting **Dead Time (t0) Mode**
to **Based on Peak**.
